# Firefox CSS Customizations

This repository contains my personal CSS tweaks and customizations for Mozilla Firefox. These styles modify the appearance and behavior of Firefox's user interface to better suit my preferences.

## Installation

1. **Locate Your Firefox Profile Folder**:
   - Open Firefox and type `about:support` in the address bar.
   - Under the "Application Basics" section, find "Profile Folder" and click "Open Folder".

2. **Create a `chrome` Folder**:
   - Inside your profile folder, create a new directory named `chrome` (if it doesnâ€™t already exist).

3. **Copy CSS Files**:
   - Download or clone this repository.
   - Copy the `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` files from this repository into the `chrome` folder in your Firefox profile.

4. **Restart Firefox**:
   - Restart Firefox to apply the new styles.
